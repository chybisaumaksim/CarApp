### Practical task for Module 11&12

Using the provided skeleton, implement the REST service:
1. Run existing skeleton: 
    
        1.1 mvn clean install
        1.2 java -jar target/pt11_12-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
        
        2.1 In IDE just run PtApplication class

2. Check that the application is running. Open the link http://localhost:8080/pt11/ in your browser. You should see "Spring is here!".
